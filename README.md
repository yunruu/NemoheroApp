# NemoheroApp
A gamified friend-making application.

## Project Rationale
The project is created in lieu of the team's interest in creating an anonymous platform for NUS students, especially freshmen, to find other students that they can connect with through an engaging and straightforward manner. The level of anonymity is especially critical for those who are more introverted and find it difficult to interact with strangers in a physical environment, or those who have little time to spare to indulge in such interactions. The matchmaking algorithm provides students with some control over the students they get to meet via the application, allowing the experience to be more comfortable and efficient. The gamified elements add a vibrant and appealing touch to the otherwise run-of-the-mill concept of friend-making applications, and also acts as a potential conversational starter.
